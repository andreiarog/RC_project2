A quick start: https://zhiyzuo.github.io/python-modularity-maximization/

All the datasets in ``./data`` comes from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/

Specifically, ``big_10_football_directed.gml`` is compiled by myself to test community detection for directed network. I combined data from http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/conferences/big-ten/2005-schedule.html and the original ``football.gml`` to define the edge directions.

Change log:

- 02-23-2018
  Test on Python 3

- 10-20-2017
  Updated python codes to use NetworkX 2 APIs. See https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/release/release_2.0.html.
  Later in the day, I added a wrapper function to retrieve the largest eigenvalue and vector for 2x2 matrices since scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs do not work in that case.
